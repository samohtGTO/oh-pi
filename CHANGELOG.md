# Changelog

## 0.4.4 (2026-04-02)

### Features

- show clickable PR link in custom footer (#79)
- add /status overlay command (#80)
- add `/status` command that opens an overlay showing model, session, context window, workspace, git branch, PR link, extension statuses, and safe-mode state.
- show the current PR as a clickable hyperlink in the custom footer when a PR is open for the current branch.

### Fixes

- gate specs/ dir fallback on non-git repos only (#74)
- support Windows by using shell mode for execFileSync (#76)
- add safe mode awareness, reduce tick frequency, and fix memory leaks (#78)
- fix `findPi()` on Windows by trying `pi.cmd` first and passing `shell: true` to `execFileSync` so the npm CMD shim is resolved correctly.
- Add safe mode awareness to the scheduler extension, reducing tick frequency and suppressing UI status updates when safe mode is active. Fix memory leak in dispatch timestamp tracking by replacing unbounded `shift()` pruning with a capped `splice()` approach and clearing timestamps on scheduler stop.
- standardize MDT documentation reuse on `pnpm mdt` across repo docs, scripts, and CI.

## 0.4.3 (2026-04-01)

### Fixes

- suppress watchdog and scheduler notification spam (#75)
- suppress repeated watchdog and scheduler notifications by capping toast alerts at 2 per session and persisting ongoing warnings in the status bar instead.

## 0.4.2 (2026-03-31)

### Features

- show workspace and prompt in review UI (#69)
- add clear-all review shortcut (#70)

### Fixes

- persist provider usage windows (#72)
- add a clear-all shortcut to the scheduler review UI so scheduled tasks can be removed directly from the task list.
- persist provider rate limit data so usage widgets and dashboards can keep showing the last known subscription windows when live provider probes are temporarily rate-limited.
- improve the scheduler review UI by showing the workspace in task listings and the full automated prompt when a scheduled task is selected.

## 0.4.1 (2026-03-30)

### Fixes

- avoid loading helper modules as extensions (#67)
- run all workspace package builds (#68)
- fix workspace builds to run every package build script, repair the spec worktree build config, and verify published extension entrypoints are explicit files.
- fix pi package extension manifests to list explicit entrypoint files so helper modules are not loaded as standalone extensions.

## 0.4.0 (2026-03-30)

### Breaking Changes

- clarify the supported minimum pi runtime baseline in package peer dependencies and repository docs.

### Features

- add MDT-powered documentation reuse (#66)

### Fixes

- reduce long-session runtime UI churn
- improve error reporting and robustness for ant colony and subagent swarms (#56)
- prevent scheduler startup prompt replay (#59)
- isolate scheduled tasks by instance
- add shared pi agent-dir and mirrored storage path utilities to `@ifi/oh-pi-core` for consistent config and storage path resolution.
- add a shared extension runtime smoke-test harness and initial smoke coverage for scheduler/btw, ant-colony, and subagents.
- add MDT-based documentation reuse, CI verification, and synchronized API docs for shared package helpers.
- add missing package-level READMEs for published packages so npm and pi.dev package pages have package-specific documentation.
- add repository, homepage, and bugs metadata to published package manifests so npm package pages link back to the correct monorepo locations.
- add a small CI compatibility matrix that smoke-tests oh-pi extensions against the minimum supported pi baseline and a current upstream runtime.
- align root build and CI publish validation with the actual compiled and published package set, including web packages and pack dry-run checks.
- centralize pi-tui fallback resolution behind a shared loader used by shared-qna and plan runtime modules.
- document non-interactive git and GitHub CLI guidance for agent-run workflows
- document the scheduler instance-vs-workspace ownership model and the new adopt/release controls in the extensions README.
- exclude compiled test artifacts from published tarballs for compiled packages and add a CI guard to catch regressions.
- expand runtime smoke coverage for usage-tracker, auto-update, safe-guard, and spec extension registration flows.
- reduce long-session input lag by avoiding footer rescans, adding a performance watchdog, and introducing a safe mode command that suppresses nonessential UI chrome when the session gets sluggish.
- prevent scheduled prompts from being auto-run in newly opened pi instances for the same workspace by adding instance ownership, workspace-scoped opt-in tasks, scheduler leasing, takeover prompts, and explicit adopt/release/clear-foreign controls.
- fix scheduler startup replay by restoring overdue persisted tasks for manual review instead of auto-running them in a new session
- migrate hardcoded pi agent-dir paths in CLI and extensions to shared resolver utilities so custom `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` setups behave consistently.
- reduce remaining moderate production audit findings by overriding patched transitive dependency versions.
- refactor the root AGENTS.md into a progressive-disclosure layout with focused agent rule documents for engineering, packaging and release, and git/PR workflow guidance.
- refactor the scheduler extension into shared constants/types, parsing helpers, and registration modules without changing user-facing behavior.
- refactor the subagents extension by splitting bootstrap/config helpers, async runtime monitoring, and slash-command registration into focused modules.
- refactor the usage tracker by splitting shared types, formatting helpers, and provider probe logic into focused modules.

## 0.3.6 (2026-03-29)

### Features

- add option to disable emoji icons with plain ASCII fallbacks (#28)

### Fixes

- harden nest lock recovery (#21)
- move and clean up shared scheduler state (#22)
- move repo-local runtime state to shared pi storage (#23)
- handle older pi model registry in btw (#26)
- improve follow-up scheduling guidance (#29)
- add and refine npm keywords across the remaining published packages to improve discovery on pi.dev/packages.
- fix ant-colony nest lock recovery and ensure colony IDs stay unique under concurrent launches.
- fix BTW API key resolution on older pi runtimes that do not expose `ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKey()`.
- improve scheduler tool descriptions so pi is more likely to use scheduled follow-ups for PRs, CI, builds, deployments, and other future check-ins.
- Move ant-colony runtime state and isolated worktree directories out of repository-local `.ant-colony/` folders into a shared pi agent storage root under `~/.pi/agent/ant-colony/...` by default. Legacy local colony state is migrated automatically, `.gitignore` is no longer modified in the default shared mode, and an explicit `storageMode: "project"` opt-in remains available for users who prefer the old repo-local behavior.
- Move scheduler state out of repository-local `.pi/scheduler.json` files into a shared pi agent directory under `~/.pi/agent/scheduler/...`, using a path that mirrors each workspace path for uniqueness. Legacy repo-local scheduler files are migrated automatically when discovered, and defunct scheduler stores are cleaned up once all tasks expire or are removed.
- Move subagent project-scope agent and chain definitions out of repo-local `.pi/agents/` folders into a shared pi agent directory under `~/.pi/agent/subagents/project-agents/...` by default. Legacy project-local definitions are migrated automatically when discovered, mirrored parent workspaces are still searched for project overrides, and a `projectAgentStorageMode: "project"` opt-in keeps the old repo-local behavior available.
- Pin `picomatch` to `4.0.4` via pnpm overrides so CI security audits pass with the patched version of the transitive dependency used by the Vitest toolchain.

## 0.3.5 (2026-03-25)

### Features

- add architecture and refactor planning skills (#19)

#### Add four new skills to `@ifi/oh-pi-skills`:

- `grill-me`
- `improve-codebase-architecture` (with `REFERENCE.md`)
- `request-refactor-plan`
- `write-a-skill`

### Fixes

- restore anthropic and google rate-limit display (#20)

#### Fix usage-tracker provider display regressions:

- Treat Anthropic OAuth `utilization` as percentage values (so `1.0` means 1% used, not 100% used).
- Preserve last known provider windows when transient probe responses report rate-limited/unavailable with no windows.
- For Google Cloud Code Assist tiers that explicitly state "unlimited", show a `Subscription quota` window at 100% instead of only showing "windows unavailable".

## 0.3.4 (2026-03-24)

### Fixes

- truncate usage widget lines by terminal width (#18)
- Fix usage-tracker widget line truncation by respecting the terminal `width` in widget `render(width)` and applying `truncateAnsi` to each rendered line. This prevents crashes from overlong widget lines when multiple provider bars are displayed in narrow terminals.

## 0.3.3 (2026-03-23)

### Fixes

- restore openai and google usage probes (#16)

#### Fix usage-tracker provider probing for OpenAI and Google OAuth auth:

- Use ChatGPT Codex `backend-api/wham/usage` for OpenAI and parse primary/secondary/additional window usage.
- Use Google Cloud Code Assist `v1internal:loadCodeAssist` for Google OAuth metadata instead of the unsupported Generative Language models endpoint.
- Improve OpenAI/Google reporting with clearer plan/account/project details and fallback notes when window data is unavailable.

## 0.3.2 (2026-03-23)

### Fixes

- add global dispatch rate limiter fuse (#14)
- use Anthropic OAuth usage endpoint in usage tracker (#15)

#### Fix Anthropic usage probing in the usage tracker for pi-managed OAuth tokens.

- Use Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint (`/api/oauth/usage`) for `sk-ant-oat...` tokens (matching Claude Code behavior).
- Avoid false "auth token expired" errors when OAuth is valid but the old probe endpoint is unsupported.
- Surface OAuth endpoint rate limiting as an informational note instead of an auth failure.
- Keep API-key probe fallback via `count_tokens` for non-OAuth Anthropic credentials.
- Silence a pre-existing scheduler lint warning by documenting intentional cognitive complexity in task deserialization.
- Pin `fast-xml-parser` to a patched version via pnpm overrides to resolve the high-severity audit finding in CI.

#### fix(scheduler): harden `/loop` against runaway recurring schedules

- Reject cron schedules that run more frequently than once per minute
- Prevent unsafe cron parsing fallback from misreading invalid 6-field cron as 5-field
- Sanitize loaded scheduler tasks (cap to `MAX_TASKS`, drop unsafe cron entries, clamp unsafe intervals)
- Harden recurring dispatch to self-heal invalid interval values and avoid pathological next-run loops
- Add a global scheduler dispatch fuse (max 6 task dispatches per minute) to prevent burst floods
- Improve cron-related error/help text to call out the 1-minute minimum cadence

## 0.3.1 (2026-03-15)

### Features

- add creative and multimodal builtin agents
- replace CLI probing with direct API auth in usage-tracker
- add web server, client, and /remote extension

### Fixes

- auto-refresh expired OAuth tokens and handle OpenAI 403
- Auto-refresh expired OAuth tokens in the usage-tracker extension using pi's built-in OAuth module. Handles OpenAI 403 gracefully for subscription tokens. Parses Google Antigravity JSON-encoded API keys for direct API calls.

## 0.3.0 (2026-03-14)

### Breaking Changes

#### Add remote web management for pi instances.

Introduces three new packages for controlling a pi session from any browser or mobile device:

- `@ifi/pi-web-server` — Embeddable HTTP + WebSocket server that bridges a pi `AgentSession` to remote clients with token-based auth, auto-tunnel detection (cloudflared/tailscale), and QR code generation.
- `@ifi/pi-web-remote` — Pi extension that registers the `/remote` command. One command, zero config: starts the server, auto-detects connectivity, and displays a QR code to scan.
- `@ifi/pi-web-client` — Platform-agnostic TypeScript client library (zero dependencies) that works in browsers, React Native, and Node.js.

Also includes a headless daemon mode (`pi-web serve`) for long-running always-on instances.

### Features

- add creative and multimodal builtin agents
- replace CLI probing with direct API auth in usage-tracker
- add web server, client, and /remote extension
- Replace CLI-based rate limit probing with direct API calls using pi-managed auth tokens. The usage-tracker extension no longer shells out to external `claude` or `codex` CLI tools. Instead, it reads OAuth credentials from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` and queries provider APIs directly (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). Adds Google provider support. Updates `/usage` overlay, widget, and `Ctrl+U` dashboard to probe all configured providers.

#### Add new builtin subagents for creative and multimodal tasks.

- add an `artist` agent tuned for SVG creation and concrete visual asset briefs using `gemini-3.1-pro-high`
- add a `frontend-designer` agent tuned for distinctive, production-grade UI implementation using `claude-opus-4-6`
- add a `multimodal-summariser` agent tuned for summarizing image, audio, and video inputs using `gemini-3-flash`
- document the new builtin agents and cover their bundled discovery in tests

### Fixes

- Fix remaining unscoped `npx oh-pi` references in `docs/DESIGN.md` to use `npx @ifi/oh-pi`.

## 0.2.16 (2026-03-14)

### Fixes

- avoid shortcut conflict with subagents
- Change the ant-colony details shortcut from `Ctrl+Shift+A` to `Ctrl+Shift+C` so it no longer conflicts with the subagents extension shortcut.

## 0.2.15 (2026-03-14)

### Features

#### Make the `pi-plan` and `pi-spec` extensions installable through the oh-pi configurator's extension workflow.

- add `plan` to the selectable extension registry alongside `spec`
- teach the CLI extension writer how to copy the `pi-plan` runtime into `.pi/agent/extensions/plan`
- vendor the plan runtime's `@ifi/pi-shared-qna` and `@ifi/pi-extension-subagents` dependencies so local installs resolve correctly
- add CLI package dependencies and regression tests covering plan/spec extension resource resolution and local extension copying

### Fixes

- install plan and spec extensions locally

## 0.2.14 (2026-03-13)

### Features

- add pi-plan planning mode package (#8)
- add native /spec workflow package

#### Improve colony isolation and cost visibility:

- run ant-colony executions in isolated git worktrees by default (with shared-cwd fallback when unavailable)
- persist/report workspace metadata so users can see where colony edits were made
- resume colonies with saved workspace hints, including worktree re-attachment when possible
- emit ant inference usage events (`usage:record`) from colony workers/soldiers/scouts
- aggregate external/background inference in usage-tracker reports, widget, and session totals
- add tests for worktree isolation and external usage ingestion

#### Add `/btw` and `/qq` side-conversation extension and skill:

- `/btw` opens a parallel side conversation without interrupting the main agent run
- `/qq` is an alias for `/btw` ("quick question")
- streams answers into a widget above the editor
- maintains a continuous thread across exchanges, persisted in session state
- keeps BTW entries out of the main agent's LLM context
- supports `--save` to persist an exchange as a visible session note
- sub-commands: `:new`, `:clear`, `:inject`, `:summarize` for thread management
- includes a `btw` skill for discoverability and guidance

Based on https://github.com/dbachelder/pi-btw by Dan Bachelder (MIT).

#### Add concrete multimodal/telemetry routing capabilities and completion verification coverage:

- add worker-class routing (`design`, `multimodal`, `backend`, `review`) with per-class model override support
- add cheap-first multimodal ingestion preprocessing and route metadata handling for worker tasks
- add promote/finalize gate types + decision logic with confidence/coverage/risk/policy/SLO reasons
- record routing telemetry (claimed/completed/failed/escalated, latency, reasons) and roll it into budget summary snapshots
- expose new ant-colony tool model override parameters for worker classes
- add focused tests for gate decisions, budget telemetry rollups, and index-level event-bus propagation
- add deterministic completion verification harness (`pnpm verify:completion`) with slash-command completion tests

#### Add a new `flutter-serverpod-mvp` skill for bootstrapping OpenBudget-style full-stack projects:

- monorepo-first Flutter + Serverpod architecture guidance
- devenv-based local runtime workflow (scripts, services, CI setup)
- hooks-first Riverpod conventions for app state and UI composition
- strict i18n rules with ARB + generated localizations and hardcoded-text checks
- GoRouter route-name constants and shell-based routing patterns with auth redirects
- end-to-end MVP scaffolding checklist from workspace setup to first feature slice

#### Add `bin` installer so `npx @ifi/oh-pi` registers all sub-packages with pi.

Supports `--version <ver>` to pin a specific version, `--local` for project-scoped
installs, and `--remove` to uninstall all oh-pi packages from pi.

#### Add `@ifi/pi-extension-subagents`, a full-featured subagent orchestration package built on top of

`nicobailon/pi-subagents`.

- vendor the upstream subagent extension runtime, TUI manager, async runner, and bundled builtin agents
- publish it as `@ifi/pi-extension-subagents` with raw TypeScript sources via the package `pi` field
- add a small `npx @ifi/pi-extension-subagents` installer/remover wrapper around `pi install/remove`
- cover the packaged helpers and discovery logic with an extensive Vitest suite
- include the new package in the `@ifi/oh-pi` installer bundle and docs

#### Add a new planning mode package, `@ifi/pi-plan`, plus a shared first-party `@ifi/pi-shared-qna`

library in the monorepo.

- vendor the `plan-md` workflow from `sids/pi-extensions` into `packages/plan` and adapt it to the `/plan` command
- back plan research tasks with the in-repo subagent runtime from `@ifi/pi-extension-subagents`
- vendor the shared Q&A TUI component into `packages/shared-qna` to avoid third-party pi package dependencies
- include `@ifi/pi-plan` in the `@ifi/oh-pi` bundle and monorepo docs
- add Vitest coverage for plan flow, prompts, state, request-user-input, task agents, utilities, and shared Q&A helpers

#### Add `@ifi/pi-spec`, a native spec-driven workflow package for pi built as raw TypeScript instead of

shell-script wrappers.

- publish a new `@ifi/pi-spec` package that registers a single `/spec` command with status, init,
  constitution, specify, clarify, checklist, plan, tasks, analyze, implement, list, and next flows
- vendor spec-kit-inspired workflow templates into the package and scaffold them into `.specify/`
  for per-repository customization
- implement native repo detection, feature numbering, branch naming, git branch creation, checklist
  summaries, and prompt handoff entirely in TypeScript
- add comprehensive Vitest coverage for workspace helpers, scaffold creation, prompt generation, and
  command behavior
- integrate the new package into the oh-pi installer, CLI resource copying, extension registry, and
  repo documentation

#### Add a new `rust-workspace-bootstrap` skill that scaffolds a Rust workspace template inspired by `mdt` and `pina`, including:

- knope changeset + release workflows
- devenv/direnv setup with common Rust scripts
- GitHub Actions for CI, coverage, semver checks, release preview, and release assets
- core + CLI crate starter structure
- enforced crate naming convention using underscores (`_`) instead of hyphens (`-`)

#### Add scheduler extension with `/loop`, `/remind`, `/schedule`, and `/unschedule` commands:

- `/loop` creates recurring scheduled prompts with interval or cron expressions
- `/remind` creates one-time reminders with delay durations
- `/schedule` manages tasks via TUI manager or subcommands (list, enable, disable, delete, clear)
- `/unschedule` is an alias for `/schedule delete <id>`
- Exposes `schedule_prompt` LLM-callable tool for agent-driven scheduling
- Tasks run only when pi is idle; recurring tasks auto-expire after 3 days
- State is persisted to `.pi/scheduler.json` across sessions
- Supports both interval (5m, 2h) and cron expressions (5-field and 6-field)
- Max 50 active tasks with jitter to prevent thundering herd

Based on pi-scheduler by @manojlds (MIT).

#### Enhance the usage tracker dashboard to provide CodexBar-style depth:

- richer provider window rows with both **% left** and **% used**
- inferred **pace analysis** for time-based windows (expected usage vs actual, runout hint)
- provider metadata in reports (plan/account when discoverable)
- constrained-window summary and updated-age lines
- expanded session analytics (avg per turn, cache read/write, cost burn rate)
- richer per-model breakdown (cost share, avg tokens/turn, cache lines)
- force-refresh probing for `/usage`, `Ctrl+U`, and `usage_report`
- fallback to `claude auth status` metadata when modern Claude CLI builds do not expose usage windows
- clearer notes when provider windows are unavailable (e.g. non-interactive TTY/permission constraints)
- regression tests for the new detailed report/overlay content

### Fixes

- skip dependency review when dependency graph is unavailable (#9)
- add missing exports to pi-shared-qna and pi-spec packages
- Make the CI dependency review job skip cleanly when GitHub dependency graph manifests are not yet available for the repository, instead of failing the whole pull request with a repository settings error.
- Add missing `exports` to `pi-shared-qna` and `pi-spec` packages so `require.resolve` can find their `package.json`.

#### Harden and align ant-colony runtime behavior:

- fix final report signal emission to be status-aware (`COMPLETE` for success, failure status otherwise)
- replace raw drone shell execution with an allowlisted `execFileSync` command policy
- update `/colony-resume` to resume all resumable colonies by default when no ID is provided
- add stable colony ID tracking alongside runtime IDs and support both in status/stop command resolution
- share usage-limits tracker instances across runs to avoid listener buildup in runtimes without `off()`
- add integration tests for multi-colony command workflows and signal consistency
- refresh ant-colony README command and installation docs

#### Fix ant-colony JSON task-plan parsing so malformed scout output no longer produces invalid execution plans:

- only accept fenced JSON plans when they are task arrays, nested `tasks` arrays, or single task-like objects
- ignore JSON entries that omit both `title` and `description`
- normalize JSON task titles/descriptions consistently with markdown task parsing
- add parser regression tests for nested JSON plans and missing task fields

#### Improve project automation ergonomics:

- fix pull-request conventional-commit validation to lint real PR commits instead of synthetic merge commit messages
- update `knope document-change` workflow to run `pnpm format` after creating a changeset file

#### Update GitHub Actions workflow dependencies to current releases:

- upgrade `actions/checkout` to `v6.0.2`
- upgrade `actions/setup-node` to `v6.3.0`
- upgrade `pnpm/action-setup` to `v4.4.0`
- upgrade `actions/dependency-review-action` to `v4.9.0`

#### Document and enforce the lockstep knope changeset format:

- document the `default`-only frontmatter rule in AGENTS, README, and CONTRIBUTING
- require `.changeset/*.md` files to use `default` as the only frontmatter key
- validate the rule in CI so package-name frontmatter entries fail fast
- normalize pending changesets to the lockstep `default` format

#### Drop `bundledDependencies` and the `pi` resource manifest from the meta-package.

Pi loads each package with its own module root, so extensions nested inside a
meta-package's `node_modules/` cannot resolve peer-dep imports
(`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, etc.). This caused commands like `/colony` and
`/loop` to silently fail to register.

Each sub-package (`@ifi/oh-pi-extensions`, `@ifi/oh-pi-ant-colony`, etc.) is
already a fully self-contained pi package with its own `pi` field. Users should
install them directly via `pi install npm:@ifi/oh-pi-<name>` so pi can load
extensions with correct module resolution.

The `@ifi/oh-pi` npm package remains as a convenience dependency that pulls all
sub-packages, but no longer declares pi resources itself.

#### Harden release safety with security gates:

- add `pnpm security:check` (dependency allowlist + vulnerability audits)
- run security checks in CI (`security` job) and PR dependency review (`dependency-review` job)
- require security checks in local release flow (`scripts/release.sh`) and `knope release` workflow
- use strict production audit threshold (`pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high`)
- pin vulnerable transitive `file-type` to `21.3.1` via pnpm override

#### Remove Mandarin Chinese from the project:

- delete `README.zh.md` and `docs/DEMO-SCRIPT.zh.md`
- remove `zh` locale from core types, i18n, and locales
- remove Chinese keywords from ant-colony parser regex patterns
- remove Chinese detection from colony status and scout quorum
- translate Chinese JSDoc comments to English
- update language selectors across all READMEs

#### Disable `safe-guard` as a default-enabled extension going forward:

- mark `safe-guard` as opt-in in the core extension registry used by setup flows
- remove `safe-guard` from quick-mode default extension selection in the CLI
- update the `@ifi/oh-pi` meta-package manifest to exclude `safe-guard` from default loaded extensions
- refresh docs to clarify `safe-guard` is available but not enabled by default

#### Keep `safe-guard` opt-in across the configurator defaults by removing it from the "Full Power"

preset, updating preset copy/docs, and adding a regression test for preset extension selections.

### Features

- isolate ant colonies in worktrees and track background inference (#1)
- add rust workspace bootstrap scaffolder (#3)
- add flutter serverpod mvp bootstrap skill

### Fixes

- classify CLI 401 auth failures in usage tracker
- make safe-guard opt-in by default

## 0.2.8 (2026-03-08)

### Fixes

- enforce zero-warning lint and harden colony event bus

#### Zero-warning lint baseline + fail on warnings

- Fixed all Biome warnings across the repo (0 warnings, 0 errors).
- Updated lint commands to fail on warnings:
  - `pnpm lint` now runs `biome check --error-on-warnings .`
  - `pnpm check` now runs `biome ci --error-on-warnings .`
- Updated CI lint job to enforce `--error-on-warnings`.

#### Ant colony runtime fix: event bus compatibility

Fixed colony failures in environments where `pi.events.off` is not implemented.

- `ColonyEventBus.off` is now optional.
- Added `createUsageLimitsTracker()` to safely query usage-tracker limits with
  support for both `on/emit/off` and `on/emit` event buses.
- Prevents `TypeError: opts.eventBus.off is not a function` during colony runs.
- Added regression tests for event buses with and without `off()`.

## 0.2.7 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- support multiple concurrent ant colonies

#### Support multiple concurrent colonies

The ant colony extension now supports running multiple colonies simultaneously.
Each colony gets a short ID (`c1`, `c2`, ...) shown in all status output, signals,
and the details panel.

**New commands:**

- `/colony-count` — shows how many colonies are active with their IDs and goals

**Updated commands:**

- `/colony <goal>` — launches a new colony (no longer blocked by existing ones)
- `/colony-status [id]` — shows one colony by ID, or all if no ID given (with autocomplete)
- `/colony-stop [id|all]` — stops a specific colony by ID, or all if no ID / `all` given (with autocomplete)
- `/colony-resume [colonyId]` — resumes a specific persisted colony, or the most recent one
- `ant_colony` tool — no longer rejects when a colony is already running

**Details panel (Ctrl+Shift+A):**

- Colony selector header when multiple are running
- Press `n` to cycle between colonies

**Backwards compatible:**

- Existing `.ant-colony/` directories on disk are unmodified — `findResumable` still works
- Single-colony usage is unchanged (commands auto-resolve when only one colony exists)
- New `Nest.findAllResumable()` method finds all resumable colonies sorted by creation date

## 0.2.6 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- add /colony slash command for direct colony launch

### Fixes

#### Add `/colony` slash command

The ant colony can now be launched directly with `/colony <goal>` instead of
relying solely on the LLM-callable `ant_colony` tool. The command appears in
autocomplete alongside `/colony-status`, `/colony-stop`, and `/colony-resume`.

Usage: `/colony refactor the auth module to use JWT tokens`

## 0.2.5 (2026-03-08)

### Fixes

- ANSI-aware truncation for usage dashboard overlay

#### Fix usage dashboard truncation cutting through ANSI escape codes

The `/usage` overlay and `Ctrl+U` dashboard now use ANSI-aware line truncation.
Previously, lines were sliced by raw string length which could cut through ANSI
escape sequences mid-code, causing garbled colors and broken terminal rendering.

The new `truncateAnsi()` helper walks the string character by character, skipping
ANSI sequences when counting visible width, and appends a reset (`\x1b[0m`) if
the line is trimmed inside a styled region.

## 0.2.4 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- rewrite configuration wizard UX
- monorepo restructure under @ifi/\* scope
- detailed changesets, markdown formatting, knope publish workflow
- usage-aware budget planner for ant colony
- auto-unbind deleteToLineStart from ctrl+u on extension load

#### Usage-aware budget planner for ant colony

The ant colony now queries the usage-tracker extension for real-time provider rate limits
(Claude session/weekly %, Codex 5h/weekly %) and session cost data to intelligently allocate
resources across scout, worker, and soldier castes.

**New module: `budget-planner.ts`**

- Classifies budget severity (comfortable → moderate → tight → critical) from rate limits and cost
- Allocates per-caste budgets: scouts 10%, workers 70%, soldiers 20%, drones free
- Caps concurrency based on severity (critical=1, tight=2, moderate=3, comfortable=6)
- Reduces per-ant turn counts when budget is constrained
- Generates budget-awareness prompt sections injected into ant system prompts

**Usage-tracker event broadcasting**

- `usage:limits` event broadcast after each turn with rate limit windows, session cost, per-model data
- `usage:query` event listener responds with current data for on-demand queries
- Other extensions can listen to `usage:limits` for dashboard/alerting

**Integration points**

- Queen refreshes budget plan before each phase (scouting, working, reviewing)
- Adaptive concurrency controller respects budget-plan caps
- Ant prompts include budget awareness when severity is moderate or worse
- 66 tests for budget planner, 6 tests for event broadcasting (325 total)

#### Fixed: usage-tracker shortcut conflict

`Ctrl+U` is kept as the usage dashboard shortcut. The extension now auto-configures
`~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json` on first load to unbind `deleteToLineStart` from `ctrl+u`,
eliminating the conflict warning without requiring manual user configuration.

### Fixes

- CI builds core before typecheck and tests
- remove composite/references, use plain tsgo resolution
- rename npm scope from @ifi to @ifiokjr
- revert npm scope back to @ifi
- revert usage-tracker shortcut to ctrl+u

## 0.2.3 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- rewrite configuration wizard UX
- monorepo restructure under @ifi/\* scope
- detailed changesets, markdown formatting, knope publish workflow

### Fixes

- CI builds core before typecheck and tests
- remove composite/references, use plain tsgo resolution
- rename npm scope from @ifi to @ifiokjr
- revert npm scope back to @ifi

#### Reverted npm scope back to `@ifi`

The scope was incorrectly changed to `@ifiokjr` due to a misdiagnosed npm auth issue.
The real problem was token permissions, not the scope name. All packages are back to `@ifi/*`.

## 0.2.2 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- rewrite configuration wizard UX
- monorepo restructure under @ifi/\* scope
- detailed changesets, markdown formatting, knope publish workflow

### Fixes

- CI builds core before typecheck and tests
- remove composite/references, use plain tsgo resolution
- rename npm scope from @ifi to @ifiokjr

#### Renamed npm scope from `@ifi` to `@ifiokjr`

The `@ifi` scope didn't exist as an npm organization. All packages are now published under
`@ifi/*` which matches the npm username and works without org setup.

- `@ifi/oh-pi` → `@ifi/oh-pi`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-core` → `@ifi/oh-pi-core`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-cli` → `@ifi/oh-pi-cli`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-extensions` → `@ifi/oh-pi-extensions`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-ant-colony` → `@ifi/oh-pi-ant-colony`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-themes` → `@ifi/oh-pi-themes`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-prompts` → `@ifi/oh-pi-prompts`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-skills` → `@ifi/oh-pi-skills`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-agents` → `@ifi/oh-pi-agents`

## 0.2.1 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- rewrite configuration wizard UX
- monorepo restructure under @ifi/\* scope
- detailed changesets, markdown formatting, knope publish workflow

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-agents` — Initial release

5 AGENTS.md templates providing role-specific AI guidelines.

- **General Developer** — Universal coding guidelines covering code style, testing, documentation,
  and PR etiquette
- **Full-Stack Developer** — Frontend, backend, and database conventions with framework-specific
  guidance
- **Security Researcher** — Penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and OWASP audit
  methodology
- **Data & AI Engineer** — MLOps pipelines, data processing, model training, and experiment tracking
- **Colony Operator** — Multi-agent orchestration guidelines for the ant-colony swarm system

Each template is a markdown file placed at `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` to guide the AI's behavior.

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-ant-colony` — Initial release

Multi-agent swarm extension modeled after real ant ecology.

- **Colony lifecycle**: SCOUTING → PLANNING_RECOVERY → WORKING → REVIEWING → DONE with automatic
  phase transitions
- **Three ant castes**: Scouts (fast/cheap models for exploration), Workers (capable models for code
  changes), Soldiers (thorough models for review)
- **In-process agents**: Each ant is an `AgentSession` via pi SDK — zero startup overhead, shared
  auth and model registry
- **Pheromone communication**: `.ant-colony/pheromone.jsonl` shared discovery log with 10-minute
  half-life decay
- **Adaptive concurrency**: Auto-tunes parallelism based on throughput, CPU load (>85% reduction),
  and 429 rate limit backoff (2s→5s→10s cap)
- **File locking**: One ant per file — conflicting tasks are blocked and resume when locks release
- **Planning recovery**: When scouts return unstructured intel, colony enters `planning_recovery`
  instead of failing
- **Plan validation gate**: Tasks are validated (title/description/caste/priority) before workers
  start
- **Scout quorum**: Multi-step goals default to ≥2 scouts for better planning reliability
- **Real-time UI**: Status bar with task progress, active ants, tool calls, cost; `Ctrl+Shift+A`
  overlay panel; `/colony-stop` abort command
- **Signal protocol**: Structured `COLONY_SIGNAL:*` messages pushed to main conversation (LAUNCHED,
  SCOUTING, WORKING, REVIEWING, COMPLETE, FAILED, BUDGET_EXCEEDED)
- **Turn budgets**: Scout: 8, Worker: 15, Soldier: 8 — prevents runaway execution
- **Auto-trigger**: LLM deploys colony when ≥3 files need changes or parallel workstreams are
  possible

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-cli` — Initial release

Interactive TUI configurator that sets up `~/.pi/agent/` in under a minute.

- **Three setup modes**: Quick (3 steps), Preset (2 steps), Custom (6 steps) — each tailored to
  different experience levels
- **Provider auto-detection**: Scans environment variables for API keys from 7 providers (Anthropic,
  OpenAI, Google Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, xAI, Mistral) and pre-fills configuration
- **TUI components**: Built on `@clack/prompts` with styled selection menus for providers,
  extensions, themes, keybindings, skills, and AGENTS.md templates
- **File writers**: Generates `auth.json` (0600 permissions), `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`,
  `AGENTS.md`, and copies extension/theme/prompt/skill files into `~/.pi/agent/`
- **Backup detection**: Warns when existing configuration exists and offers timestamped backup
  before overwriting
- **Binary entry point**: Ships as `oh-pi` CLI via `npx @ifi/oh-pi-cli`

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-core` — Initial release

Shared foundation library for all oh-pi packages.

- **Type system**: Full TypeScript type definitions for `OhPConfig`, `ProviderConfig`,
  `WizardBaseConfig`, `Preset`, and all extension/theme/skill/prompt registries
- **Extension registry**: Declarative `EXTENSIONS` array with metadata (name, description, file
  path, default-on/off, category) for all 9 extensions including the new `usage-tracker`
- **Theme registry**: 6 theme definitions (oh-pi Dark, Cyberpunk, Nord, Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo
  Night, Gruvbox Dark) with file paths and emoji indicators
- **Prompt registry**: 10 prompt template registrations (`/review`, `/fix`, `/explain`, `/refactor`,
  `/test`, `/commit`, `/pr`, `/security`, `/optimize`, `/document`)
- **Skill registry**: 10 skill definitions across tool, UI-design, and workflow categories
- **i18n module**: Bilingual (English/Chinese) translation system with locale detection and `t()`
  helper function
- **Preset system**: Pre-configured profiles (Full Power, Clean, Colony Only) mapping to curated
  extension/theme/thinking-level combinations

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-extensions` — Initial release

9 pi extensions that hook into the pi SDK event system.

- **safe-guard** (default: on) — Intercepts destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`,
  `DROP TABLE`, `chmod 777`) and protected path writes. Prompts for confirmation or blocks outright
  via `tool_call` event hooks
- **git-guard** (default: on) — Auto-creates `git stash` checkpoints on session start when repo is
  dirty. Tracks changed files from write/edit tool results
- **auto-session-name** (default: on) — Extracts a short title from the first user message on
  `turn_end` and calls `pi.setSessionName()`
- **custom-footer** (default: on) — Rich status bar showing model, input/output tokens, cost,
  context %, elapsed time, working directory, and git branch. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- **compact-header** (default: on) — Dense one-liner startup header replacing the verbose default
- **auto-update** (default: on) — Async npm version check on `session_start` via `pi.exec()` with
  semver comparison and upgrade notification
- **bg-process** (default: off) — Overrides the built-in `bash` tool to auto-background commands
  exceeding 10 seconds. Provides `bg_status` tool for listing, viewing logs, and stopping background
  processes
- **usage-tracker** (default: off) — CodexBar-inspired rate limit and cost monitor. Probes `claude`
  and `codex` CLIs for provider-level quota percentages and reset countdowns. Live widget, `/usage`
  overlay with `Ctrl+U`, `/usage-toggle`, `/usage-refresh` commands, and LLM-callable `usage_report`
  tool. Tracks per-model token usage with cost threshold alerts at $0.50/$1/$2/$5/$10/$25/$50

#### Infrastructure and tooling

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspace with 9 packages under `@ifi/*` npm scope
- **Biome**: Strict linting and formatting (tabs, 120 char width, double quotes, organized imports)
- **tsgo**: `@typescript/native-preview` (official TypeScript 7.0 Go port) for fast type checking
- **GitHub Actions CI**: lint → typecheck → test (Node 20 + 22) → build pipeline with changeset
  enforcement on PRs
- **Knope**: Automated changelog generation, version bumping (lockstep across all packages), git
  tagging, and GitHub releases
- **Vitest**: 254 tests across 21 test files with fake timers for fast execution
- **All documentation translated to English**: 8 main docs, supplementary docs, benchmarks,
  ant-colony README, and 16+ source file comments

- **Single install**: `pi install npm:@ifi/oh-pi` adds all extensions, themes, prompts, skills, and
  agents templates
- **Bundled dependencies**: All sub-packages are listed as `bundledDependencies` so pi gets
  everything in one `npm install`
- **Pi package manifest**: Declares extension, theme, prompt, and skill paths via the `pi` field so
  pi auto-discovers all resources
