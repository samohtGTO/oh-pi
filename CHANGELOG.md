## 0.2.8 (2026-03-08)

### Fixes

- enforce zero-warning lint and harden colony event bus

#### Zero-warning lint baseline + fail on warnings

- Fixed all Biome warnings across the repo (0 warnings, 0 errors).
- Updated lint commands to fail on warnings:
  - `pnpm lint` now runs `biome check --error-on-warnings .`
  - `pnpm check` now runs `biome ci --error-on-warnings .`
- Updated CI lint job to enforce `--error-on-warnings`.

#### Ant colony runtime fix: event bus compatibility

Fixed colony failures in environments where `pi.events.off` is not implemented.

- `ColonyEventBus.off` is now optional.
- Added `createUsageLimitsTracker()` to safely query usage-tracker limits with
  support for both `on/emit/off` and `on/emit` event buses.
- Prevents `TypeError: opts.eventBus.off is not a function` during colony runs.
- Added regression tests for event buses with and without `off()`.

## 0.2.7 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- support multiple concurrent ant colonies

#### Support multiple concurrent colonies

The ant colony extension now supports running multiple colonies simultaneously.
Each colony gets a short ID (`c1`, `c2`, ...) shown in all status output, signals,
and the details panel.

**New commands:**
- `/colony-count` — shows how many colonies are active with their IDs and goals

**Updated commands:**
- `/colony <goal>` — launches a new colony (no longer blocked by existing ones)
- `/colony-status [id]` — shows one colony by ID, or all if no ID given (with autocomplete)
- `/colony-stop [id|all]` — stops a specific colony by ID, or all if no ID / `all` given (with autocomplete)
- `/colony-resume [colonyId]` — resumes a specific persisted colony, or the most recent one
- `ant_colony` tool — no longer rejects when a colony is already running

**Details panel (Ctrl+Shift+A):**
- Colony selector header when multiple are running
- Press `n` to cycle between colonies

**Backwards compatible:**
- Existing `.ant-colony/` directories on disk are unmodified — `findResumable` still works
- Single-colony usage is unchanged (commands auto-resolve when only one colony exists)
- New `Nest.findAllResumable()` method finds all resumable colonies sorted by creation date

## 0.2.6 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- add /colony slash command for direct colony launch

### Fixes

#### Add `/colony` slash command

The ant colony can now be launched directly with `/colony <goal>` instead of
relying solely on the LLM-callable `ant_colony` tool. The command appears in
autocomplete alongside `/colony-status`, `/colony-stop`, and `/colony-resume`.

Usage: `/colony refactor the auth module to use JWT tokens`

## 0.2.5 (2026-03-08)

### Fixes

- ANSI-aware truncation for usage dashboard overlay

#### Fix usage dashboard truncation cutting through ANSI escape codes

The `/usage` overlay and `Ctrl+U` dashboard now use ANSI-aware line truncation.
Previously, lines were sliced by raw string length which could cut through ANSI
escape sequences mid-code, causing garbled colors and broken terminal rendering.

The new `truncateAnsi()` helper walks the string character by character, skipping
ANSI sequences when counting visible width, and appends a reset (`\x1b[0m`) if
the line is trimmed inside a styled region.

## 0.2.4 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- rewrite configuration wizard UX
- monorepo restructure under @ifi/* scope
- detailed changesets, markdown formatting, knope publish workflow
- usage-aware budget planner for ant colony
- auto-unbind deleteToLineStart from ctrl+u on extension load

#### Usage-aware budget planner for ant colony

The ant colony now queries the usage-tracker extension for real-time provider rate limits
(Claude session/weekly %, Codex 5h/weekly %) and session cost data to intelligently allocate
resources across scout, worker, and soldier castes.

**New module: `budget-planner.ts`**
- Classifies budget severity (comfortable → moderate → tight → critical) from rate limits and cost
- Allocates per-caste budgets: scouts 10%, workers 70%, soldiers 20%, drones free
- Caps concurrency based on severity (critical=1, tight=2, moderate=3, comfortable=6)
- Reduces per-ant turn counts when budget is constrained
- Generates budget-awareness prompt sections injected into ant system prompts

**Usage-tracker event broadcasting**
- `usage:limits` event broadcast after each turn with rate limit windows, session cost, per-model data
- `usage:query` event listener responds with current data for on-demand queries
- Other extensions can listen to `usage:limits` for dashboard/alerting

**Integration points**
- Queen refreshes budget plan before each phase (scouting, working, reviewing)
- Adaptive concurrency controller respects budget-plan caps
- Ant prompts include budget awareness when severity is moderate or worse
- 66 tests for budget planner, 6 tests for event broadcasting (325 total)

#### Fixed: usage-tracker shortcut conflict

`Ctrl+U` is kept as the usage dashboard shortcut. The extension now auto-configures
`~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json` on first load to unbind `deleteToLineStart` from `ctrl+u`,
eliminating the conflict warning without requiring manual user configuration.

### Fixes

- CI builds core before typecheck and tests
- remove composite/references, use plain tsgo resolution
- rename npm scope from @ifi to @ifiokjr
- revert npm scope back to @ifi
- revert usage-tracker shortcut to ctrl+u

## 0.2.3 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- rewrite configuration wizard UX
- monorepo restructure under @ifi/* scope
- detailed changesets, markdown formatting, knope publish workflow

### Fixes

- CI builds core before typecheck and tests
- remove composite/references, use plain tsgo resolution
- rename npm scope from @ifi to @ifiokjr
- revert npm scope back to @ifi

#### Reverted npm scope back to `@ifi`

The scope was incorrectly changed to `@ifiokjr` due to a misdiagnosed npm auth issue.
The real problem was token permissions, not the scope name. All packages are back to `@ifi/*`.

## 0.2.2 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- rewrite configuration wizard UX
- monorepo restructure under @ifi/* scope
- detailed changesets, markdown formatting, knope publish workflow

### Fixes

- CI builds core before typecheck and tests
- remove composite/references, use plain tsgo resolution
- rename npm scope from @ifi to @ifiokjr

#### Renamed npm scope from `@ifi` to `@ifiokjr`

The `@ifi` scope didn't exist as an npm organization. All packages are now published under
`@ifi/*` which matches the npm username and works without org setup.

- `@ifi/oh-pi` → `@ifi/oh-pi`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-core` → `@ifi/oh-pi-core`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-cli` → `@ifi/oh-pi-cli`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-extensions` → `@ifi/oh-pi-extensions`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-ant-colony` → `@ifi/oh-pi-ant-colony`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-themes` → `@ifi/oh-pi-themes`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-prompts` → `@ifi/oh-pi-prompts`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-skills` → `@ifi/oh-pi-skills`
- `@ifi/oh-pi-agents` → `@ifi/oh-pi-agents`

## 0.2.1 (2026-03-08)

### Features

- rewrite configuration wizard UX
- monorepo restructure under @ifi/* scope
- detailed changesets, markdown formatting, knope publish workflow

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-agents` — Initial release

5 AGENTS.md templates providing role-specific AI guidelines.

- **General Developer** — Universal coding guidelines covering code style, testing, documentation,
  and PR etiquette
- **Full-Stack Developer** — Frontend, backend, and database conventions with framework-specific
  guidance
- **Security Researcher** — Penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and OWASP audit
  methodology
- **Data & AI Engineer** — MLOps pipelines, data processing, model training, and experiment tracking
- **Colony Operator** — Multi-agent orchestration guidelines for the ant-colony swarm system

Each template is a markdown file placed at `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` to guide the AI's behavior.

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-ant-colony` — Initial release

Multi-agent swarm extension modeled after real ant ecology.

- **Colony lifecycle**: SCOUTING → PLANNING_RECOVERY → WORKING → REVIEWING → DONE with automatic
  phase transitions
- **Three ant castes**: Scouts (fast/cheap models for exploration), Workers (capable models for code
  changes), Soldiers (thorough models for review)
- **In-process agents**: Each ant is an `AgentSession` via pi SDK — zero startup overhead, shared
  auth and model registry
- **Pheromone communication**: `.ant-colony/pheromone.jsonl` shared discovery log with 10-minute
  half-life decay
- **Adaptive concurrency**: Auto-tunes parallelism based on throughput, CPU load (>85% reduction),
  and 429 rate limit backoff (2s→5s→10s cap)
- **File locking**: One ant per file — conflicting tasks are blocked and resume when locks release
- **Planning recovery**: When scouts return unstructured intel, colony enters `planning_recovery`
  instead of failing
- **Plan validation gate**: Tasks are validated (title/description/caste/priority) before workers
  start
- **Scout quorum**: Multi-step goals default to ≥2 scouts for better planning reliability
- **Real-time UI**: Status bar with task progress, active ants, tool calls, cost; `Ctrl+Shift+A`
  overlay panel; `/colony-stop` abort command
- **Signal protocol**: Structured `COLONY_SIGNAL:*` messages pushed to main conversation (LAUNCHED,
  SCOUTING, WORKING, REVIEWING, COMPLETE, FAILED, BUDGET_EXCEEDED)
- **Turn budgets**: Scout: 8, Worker: 15, Soldier: 8 — prevents runaway execution
- **Auto-trigger**: LLM deploys colony when ≥3 files need changes or parallel workstreams are
  possible

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-cli` — Initial release

Interactive TUI configurator that sets up `~/.pi/agent/` in under a minute.

- **Three setup modes**: Quick (3 steps), Preset (2 steps), Custom (6 steps) — each tailored to
  different experience levels
- **Provider auto-detection**: Scans environment variables for API keys from 7 providers (Anthropic,
  OpenAI, Google Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, xAI, Mistral) and pre-fills configuration
- **TUI components**: Built on `@clack/prompts` with styled selection menus for providers,
  extensions, themes, keybindings, skills, and AGENTS.md templates
- **File writers**: Generates `auth.json` (0600 permissions), `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`,
  `AGENTS.md`, and copies extension/theme/prompt/skill files into `~/.pi/agent/`
- **Backup detection**: Warns when existing configuration exists and offers timestamped backup
  before overwriting
- **Binary entry point**: Ships as `oh-pi` CLI via `npx @ifi/oh-pi-cli`

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-core` — Initial release

Shared foundation library for all oh-pi packages.

- **Type system**: Full TypeScript type definitions for `OhPConfig`, `ProviderConfig`,
  `WizardBaseConfig`, `Preset`, and all extension/theme/skill/prompt registries
- **Extension registry**: Declarative `EXTENSIONS` array with metadata (name, description, file
  path, default-on/off, category) for all 9 extensions including the new `usage-tracker`
- **Theme registry**: 6 theme definitions (oh-pi Dark, Cyberpunk, Nord, Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo
  Night, Gruvbox Dark) with file paths and emoji indicators
- **Prompt registry**: 10 prompt template registrations (`/review`, `/fix`, `/explain`, `/refactor`,
  `/test`, `/commit`, `/pr`, `/security`, `/optimize`, `/document`)
- **Skill registry**: 10 skill definitions across tool, UI-design, and workflow categories
- **i18n module**: Bilingual (English/Chinese) translation system with locale detection and `t()`
  helper function
- **Preset system**: Pre-configured profiles (Full Power, Clean, Colony Only) mapping to curated
  extension/theme/thinking-level combinations

#### `@ifi/oh-pi-extensions` — Initial release

9 pi extensions that hook into the pi SDK event system.

- **safe-guard** (default: on) — Intercepts destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`,
  `DROP TABLE`, `chmod 777`) and protected path writes. Prompts for confirmation or blocks outright
  via `tool_call` event hooks
- **git-guard** (default: on) — Auto-creates `git stash` checkpoints on session start when repo is
  dirty. Tracks changed files from write/edit tool results
- **auto-session-name** (default: on) — Extracts a short title from the first user message on
  `turn_end` and calls `pi.setSessionName()`
- **custom-footer** (default: on) — Rich status bar showing model, input/output tokens, cost,
  context %, elapsed time, working directory, and git branch. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- **compact-header** (default: on) — Dense one-liner startup header replacing the verbose default
- **auto-update** (default: on) — Async npm version check on `session_start` via `pi.exec()` with
  semver comparison and upgrade notification
- **bg-process** (default: off) — Overrides the built-in `bash` tool to auto-background commands
  exceeding 10 seconds. Provides `bg_status` tool for listing, viewing logs, and stopping background
  processes
- **usage-tracker** (default: off) — CodexBar-inspired rate limit and cost monitor. Probes `claude`
  and `codex` CLIs for provider-level quota percentages and reset countdowns. Live widget, `/usage`
  overlay with `Ctrl+U`, `/usage-toggle`, `/usage-refresh` commands, and LLM-callable `usage_report`
  tool. Tracks per-model token usage with cost threshold alerts at $0.50/$1/$2/$5/$10/$25/$50

#### Infrastructure and tooling

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspace with 9 packages under `@ifi/*` npm scope
- **Biome**: Strict linting and formatting (tabs, 120 char width, double quotes, organized imports)
- **tsgo**: `@typescript/native-preview` (official TypeScript 7.0 Go port) for fast type checking
- **GitHub Actions CI**: lint → typecheck → test (Node 20 + 22) → build pipeline with changeset
  enforcement on PRs
